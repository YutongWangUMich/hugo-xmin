# HUGO XMIN

## _Keep it simple, but not simpler_

**XMin** is a Hugo theme written by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name). This is a fork written by [Yutong Wang](https://github.com/beeflavor/) to extend the functionality of XMin for maintaining an [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) based electronic lab notebook.
