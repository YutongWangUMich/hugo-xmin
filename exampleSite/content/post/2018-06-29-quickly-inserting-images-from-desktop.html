<p>Suppose you took a screen cap on a mac using <code>Shift-Command-4</code>. You can use my RStudio addin <a href="https://github.com/beeflavor/useful-blogdown-addins">“Insert image from desktop”</a> to automatically add the image to the post. In general, the addin copies the newest .jpg, .png., or .gif file into the blogdown website directory.</p>
