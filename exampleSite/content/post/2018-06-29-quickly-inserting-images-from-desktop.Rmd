Suppose you took a screen cap on a mac using `Shift-Command-4`. You can use my RStudio addin ["Insert image from desktop"](https://github.com/beeflavor/useful-blogdown-addins) to automatically add the image to the post. In general, the addin copies the newest .jpg, .png., or .gif file into the blogdown website directory.
