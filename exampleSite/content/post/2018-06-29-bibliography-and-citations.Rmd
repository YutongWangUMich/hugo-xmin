# Basic usage

1. Put your .bib files in the `content/post` directory. Say your file is named `references.bib`.
2. Put `bibliography: [references.bib]` in the metadata of a post.
3. Use the R package [citr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/citr/README.html) to insert citations.

# Bibliography management software

We recommend you use the [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/) for citation management, which is a software for managing .bib files.

To make BibDesk work with markdown, do the following:

1. Go to `Preferences -> Template Files`.

2. Edit `citeServiceTemplate.txt` so that its content is

```
@<$publications.citeKey.@componentsJoinedByDefaultJoinString/>
```

3. Go to  `Preferences -> Citation Behavior`.

4. Set the `Default format` option to `Template`. Set its corresponding `Template` option to `citeServiceTemplate`. It should look like the following:

Now you can drag directly from BibDesk into RStudio.
